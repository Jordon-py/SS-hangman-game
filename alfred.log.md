## 2026-02-17
- **Files analyzed:** Existing README and repository root assets.
- **Bugs/improvements identified:** Existing repo structure did not match requested full-stack AuralMind app layout.
- **Fixes implemented:** Scaffolded backend FastAPI service, frontend React/Vite app, root script, environment examples, and updated README to match new architecture.
- **Warnings/unresolved:** Original script content was not present in repository; a functional CLI placeholder was created as `auralmind_match_maestro_v7_3_expert1.py`.
